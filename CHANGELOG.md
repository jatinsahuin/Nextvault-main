# NextVault MVP Changelog

---

## Development Philosophy

Every completed ticket must satisfy one principle:

> **If a feature doesn't make NextVault feel more intelligent, simpler, or more trustworthy, it probably doesn't belong.**

We prioritize:

- Product thinking over feature accumulation
- Purposeful motion over excessive animation
- Performance over visual complexity
- Consistency over novelty
- Calm, confident design over flashy effects
